# Sourced (never executed) by replit-build.sh and replit-run.sh. The .replit
# [deployment] section is the only caller of those two scripts; the Replit
# workspace boots the app through [workflows] instead and never sources this
# file. So the base variables hold the DEV Clerk instance and are what the
# workspace uses, while the published app gets the PRD_ values.
#
# To give the published app its own value for <NAME>, set PRD_<NAME> in
# Replit Configurations (or Secrets, for the secret key). Leave PRD_<NAME>
# unset to share the base value across both environments.
#
# Sourced with `set -u` active, hence the `:-` guards on indirect lookups.
